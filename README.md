Discoverning Governing Equations from Data
==========================================
The purpose of this learning project is to reproduce the results from this [**arXiv.org**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03580) paper.  This
paper describes how to build a regression model that can determine the parameters of the equations used to generate the training data.  This 
implementation will just focus on reproducing the results of the **Lozenz System**.  A copy of the research paper is located in
the docs folder.

## Project Goals
------------
- [ ] Implement Python Generator to generate sample training data from Lorenz System.
- [ ] Implement Regression algorithm using Scikit-Learn to verify results.
- [ ] Implement Regression algorithm using Pytorch to verify results.
